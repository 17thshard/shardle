[Shardle](https://shardle.17thshard.com) is a version of the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) word guessing game based on Brandon Sanderson's works.

All words are taken from the titles of [Coppermind](https://coppermind.net) articles that cover *Cosmere*, *Cytoverse*, or *Reckoners* topics.

## Features

Besides all the features of the original, Shardle offers a few additional niceties that distinguish it from other versions of the game:

 * Short definition of the answer with a link to the corresponding Coppermind article
 * Play old Shardles if you missed any. The results for this will not contribute to your statistics, however
 * Know ahead of time if your guess is actually a possible answer or only helpful for finding out some letters
